# Abstract 

The goal of this project is using machine learning algorithms to detect COVID-19 abnormalities from chest radiograph. The dataset contains 6,054 chest scan images with various resolutions, including information such as ages, genders, time of scan, etc. Each of scan is labelled in one of four categories: Negative for Pneumonia, Typical Appearance, Indeterminate Appearance, and Atypical Appearance. In this project, we use ResNet-34 Model to classify those chest radiograph data and identify their health status. After implementing the algorthims, we utilize the mean Average Precision (mAP) to examine the algorithm performance across multiple classes.
